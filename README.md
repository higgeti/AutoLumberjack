# AutoLumberjack
A simple code to use LDR sensors for detecting tree branch then pressing the virtual key to keep playing using Arduino Pro Micro as HID device.

Using two LDRs and two 10k resistor, make a voltage divider and set this to analog ports A0 and A1. You may caliber the values for your screen. My hi score was 416 using this bot.

You can see it in action in the video below.
